      , I oversee a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with $800k+ in annual revenue, manage a
      team of 20+ student engineers, and work with the university to improve the
      student experience. I am a results-driven mobile application developer
      with four years of experience in Swift (iOS), Flutter, and React. One of
      my notable projects is an app designed to assist Speech Pathologists with
      their clinical assessments, receiving over 800 downloads in its first
      week. I also have experience coding in Java and Python, as well as
      deploying application backend on AWS and Google Firebase. Additionally, I
      have hands-on expertise in 3D prototyping, robotics design and
      fabrication, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). Most recently I had
      internship last summer working on mobile SDK for a fraud detection and
      analysis product. I am now doing research for the VT computer science
      department on their CSGenome project, which researches and catalogs
      different computer systems. I am currently looking for an internship or
      contract software engineering position starting in May of 2023.

I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Tenable, a cybersecurity company that provides vulnerability management solutions for organizations. During my internship, I collaborated with the Engineering team to develop new features for the Tenable.io platform, a cloud-based vulnerability management solution. I also worked on improving the user experience of the platform by fixing bugs and optimizing performance. My internship at Tenable gave me valuable experience in software development and cybersecurity, and I gained insights into the challenges and opportunities in the cybersecurity industry.
